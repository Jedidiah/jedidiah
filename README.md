ðŸ‘‹ Hello my name is Jedidiah. Iâ€™m a creative developer based in Glasgow, Scotland. I enjoy building software for mobile, desktop and web; Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have been [doing it professionally](https://jedidiah.dev/#work) for over 15 years. 

With a background originally in graphic design and animation nowadays I'm firmly in the developer camp but I still love working at the intersection where design and engineering come together. As a generalist I go where Iâ€™m needed and can make the most impact. The majority of my recent work has been in React Native or frontend/JamStack.

Iâ€™m currently taking on contracts up to 6 months in length (outside IR35), if youâ€™d like to chat about working together please [get in touch](mailto:jedidiah@ursaluna.studio).
